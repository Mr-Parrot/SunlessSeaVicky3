 GENERIC_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Victorian era is an age of industry and exploitation, of revolution and reaction. What new challenges will the times bring?"
 REV_GENERIC_FLAVOR_TEXT:1 "Dissatisfied with the direction that the so-called organized government was taking, these revolutionaries have decided to take up arms to overthrow it. Will they succeed in seizing power or will they be crushed like so many forgotten revolutions of the past?"

 #The Glacial Grimlands
 D01_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "As your ship nears the coast of the Glacial Grimlands, a foreboding chill permeates the air. The horizon is swallowed by jagged, crystalline structures, their reflections contorting in the dark water like ghostly apparitions. The ice, an impenetrable shade of blue, is marred by deep cracks, the legacy of ancient battles against the sea. The silence here is haunting, broken only by the melancholic groan of shifting glaciers. On closer inspection, shapes move in the distance; creatures, maybe, or the tricks of a weary sailor's eyes. Docking here requires both courage and desperation, for the Grimlands have claimed many a seafarer with their seductive, icy embrace. Stories abound of explorers lost amidst its frozen mazes, their voices becoming one with the mournful wails of the wind. Yet, the lure of the unknown, and the treasures buried deep within the ice, tempts many a captain to venture into the heart of this chilling enigma."

 #The Withering Wastes
 D02_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The horizon stretches infinitely, a bleak expanse of desolation where even shadows seem reluctant to linger. The ground, ashen and unyielding, is strewn with relics of forgotten times, bones of monstrous leviathans, rusted remnants of ill-fated expeditions, and half-buried statues with faces eroded by countless eons. Occasionally, a spectral breeze sweeps through, carrying with it whispers of lost souls and ancient curses. Amidst this barren landscape, remnants of ancient civilizations hint at a time when this might have been a place of grandeur and vitality. Now, it tests the mettle of those who dare traverse its grim expanse, offering treasures and tales to those who are resilient enough to endure its withering touch."

 #The Sunken Ashlands
 D03_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Sunken Ashlands, a once-thriving expanse, now languishes as a submerged testament to the capricious nature of fortune. In the days of yore, this prosperous region reveled in the warmth of volcanic soil, yielding bountiful harvests and nurturing a flourishing civilization. Alas, the whimsical nature of the earth beneath betrayed its inhabitants when a malevolent volcano erupted, entombing the entire populace and their accomplishments in an ashen grip. Now, Zailors brave enough to chart a course through these haunted lands encounter the spectral remnants of a bygone society, where the vibrant heartbeat of life has been replaced by the mournful dirge of submerged spires and drowned ambitions."

 #Survivors of the Ash
 D04_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "A clandestine nation of survivors, baptized in the sorrow of the Sunken Ashlands' demise. Stitched together from shipwrecks and the skeletal remains of once-stalwart structures, this refuge throbs with the pulse of survival. Lanterns cast feeble light upon veiled faces as survivors navigate the oppressive gloom, exchanging hushed tales of the volcano's betrayal. Will the beleaguered survivors ever wrest their erstwhile glory from the clutches of despair, or are they destined to join the spectral ashes of their forebears, their existence swallowed whole by the relentless maw of time? "

 #The Drowned Isles
 D06_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Drowned Isles—whispered with dread by the seasoned zailers of the Unterzee. These forlorn isles, crags, and weather-beaten rocks are the haunt of drownies, the spectral remnants of those claimed by the depths, untethered by the dominion of the Fathomking. Avoided by all but the most foolhardy, these accursed islands are like flames to the moths of fearful zailers. The drownies, with their spectral visages and otherworldly lamentations, sing their seductive dirges across the waves, a siren call that ensnares the unwary. To hear their haunting melody is to be sentenced to a watery grave, for the song stirs an irresistible compulsion to leap into the icy depths and join their ghostly ranks. Grim tales abound in the fog-shrouded alleys and dimly lit taverns of London. Captains return, haggard and alone, their crews vanished, lost to the siren allure of the Drowned Isles. Their accounts speak of the drownies’ sorrowful beauty, of melodies so achingly mournful that even the stoutest hearts falter. The spectral chorus calls irresistibly, a baleful invitation to eternal slumber beneath the waves."




#Whither
WHI_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Nestled within the enigmatic waters of the Unterzee, Whither stands as a beacon of intrigue. Its cobblestone pathways are trodden by inhabitants who communicate in a symphony of unanswered questions, each query more cryptic than the last. The heart of these riddles pulses from the House of the Question, where whispered tales and secrets weave an intricate web of mystery. In Whither, knowledge is an elusive prey, tantalizingly out of grasp. While the town's allure might draw one in with the promise of revelations, departures are often laden with heavier burdens of curiosity, the haunting echoes of the town's perpetual inquisitions lingering long after one has set sail." 

#Codex
CDX_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Amidst the vast zee lies Codex, a place of profound quietude.  Its residents, mute, are the forsaken souls banished from Whither, punished for providing answers in a realm of perpetual questions. Their eyes, laden with tales never voiced, speak a language of glances and silent gestures, while the irate monkeys of the island provide the sole, jarring break in the haunting stillness. Yet in this haunting silence, what does Codex conceal for times yet to unfold?"

# League of Tung-ak
# Tung-ak: Is the patron god of tribal chiefs and the ruler of the lesser spirits of Mongol mythology
ISC_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The League of Tung-ak is a loose confederation of warring Mongol tomb-colonist tribes, formed in response to the fall of the Fifth City atop the ruins of the old Khanate and the subsequent takeover of Venderbight by British tomb-colonists. United by a common enemy, the remnants of the once-mighty Khan must now respond to the threat of Venderbright and the upheavels of the Victorian era."
# OLD: "The League of Tung-ak is a loose confederation of warring Mongol tombcolonist tribes, founded in response to the fall of the fifth city on top of the old Khanate and the subsequent takeover of Venderbright by Bitish tombcolonists. United by a common enemy, how will the remnants of the mighty Khan respond to the threats of Venderbright and the rapidly approaching future." (inexhaustable advance of time and technology)"

# Xibalba
XIC_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Xibalba has fallen... Xibalba may rise once again. A forsaken echo of the past, existing somewhere between the Is and the Is-Not. Originally, a tomb colony of the Second City, as the control over the Third City continued to slip from the clasped fist of the God-Eaters, the God-Eaters increasingly attempted new convoluted schemes to maintain their powers, which required the establishment  of a base far away from the ever meddling Masters. The tomb colony was as such invaded, renamed to Xibalba, it's population enslaved, and the enviroment changed through deals with the Masters. However, the Fourth City fell,  quicker than the God-Eaters had planned, greatly weakening the power of God-Eaters and their planned magical ceremony. In desperation, the God-Eaters initiated the ceremony sooner than was planned, cracking the city between the Is and the Is-Not. Now the acolytes of the God-Eaters rule over a weakened city, desperate to correct the ceremony to return the cursed rule of the God-Eaters once again. Xibalda has fallen, yet whispers remain of Xibalda Ascendant."
